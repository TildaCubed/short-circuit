Game starts extremely simple to teach the concepts, then starts adding on to it as the levels progress.

Level Elements:
Outlets - sources of electrical energy, you will have to connect these to each other
Wires - connect these to allow energy to flow from one place to another
Logic Gates (AND, OR, and NOT) - 1 or 2 wires connect, and a signal result comes out
Diodes - allow electrical energy to flow one way, but not the other

Behind-The-Scenes Ideas:
Some kind of password system? Save the level in a custom list?
