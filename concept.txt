Puzzle game for the TI monochrome z80 models. Written in pure BASIC.
Story/Art:
You're trying to connect wires inside a computer to get it working again.
A game with a computer-based story and aesthetics.

Gameplay:
Connecting different "wires" so that they link up (wire in 1 to wire out 1, etc.)
Deal with different obstables, multiple wires, etc.
Game starts extremely simple to teach the concepts, then starts adding on to it as the levels progress.

Level Elements:
Outlets - sources of electrical energy, you will have to connect these to each other
Wires - connect these to allow energy to flow from one place to another
Logic Gates (AND, OR, and NOT) - 1 or 2 wires connect, and a signal result comes out
Diodes - allow electrical energy to flow one way, but not the other
Have a limited amount of wires, logic gates, diodes, etc. to complete the level
Each level can have multiple inlets/outlets, of different types or the same types.
(Up to 3 types: 
* ###########
* # # # # # #
* ## ## ## ##
)

Controls:
For the current demo, use the arrow keys to move your cursor.
Use PLUS and MINUS to go through your objects.
Use MODE to rotate the selected objects.
Use 2ND to place an object.
Use ALPHA to erase an object.
Once you press CLEAR, the current will run until it can't.

Behind-The-Scenes Ideas:
Some kind of password system? Save the level in a custom list?
-Win Condition Loop:
JWinslow23	This would have to be one where you actually see the circuit run
JWinslow23	Like that one game Lightbot for TI-BASIC
123outerme	Basically just a Repeat that keeps going until it hits an error or completes its run
JWinslow23	But we'll go through it one step at a time
123outerme	Yeah, I was thinking it might be pretty easy to at least get the code to start the run. You have an electric "spark" that starts in the input, with orientation going towards wherever it's facing
JWinslow23	And yeah, that's exactly my vision
123outerme	Then it just keeps moving down in a straight line until it hits an open circuit, a curved piece (which turns it at a 90 degree angle), T piece, gate, or diode
JWinslow23	And if it moves into an empty square, or enters a square in a direction such that it physically is unable to act or move, it errors out with something
JWinslow23	Like, no entering the side of receivers, and gates can't be entered through their output side
123outerme	Yeah, that's it. Maybe for simplicitiy's sake we have it test multiple types of current one after another
123outerme	But multiple types of one current should probably be tested simultaneously
123outerme	So that gates, T pieces, etc function properly
